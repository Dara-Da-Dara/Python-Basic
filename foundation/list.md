# Lists in Python

A **list** is a built-in **mutable** data type in Python that allows storing multiple values in an ordered sequence.

## **1. Creating a List**
Lists are created using square brackets `[]`.

```python
# Creating a list with different data types
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "Python", 4.5]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 'Python', 4.5]
